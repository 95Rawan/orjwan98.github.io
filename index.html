					<h3>My hobbies and interests</h3>
				
					<ul>
						<li><h4 class="dashedborder">Reading</h4> 
						<p>I read anything and everything that could possibly interest me.
							From books, to ebooks, to internet posts and articles. I am very fond of storytelling,
							and improving my language and expression skills. I am also very fond of knowledge and any mind-blowing information
							that makes the universe much more amazing than it already is. 
							Topics like Psychology, Space and Technology really satisfies my curiousity.
						</p>
						
						<p>Speaking of knowledge! Here's a small scientific wonder: Did you know that our solar system most likely started from a floating cloud of 
							star dust and gas that's suspected to have collapsed on itself thus start the birth of our sun?
							In case you didn't, <a href="https://www.space.com/35526-solar-system-formation.html">now you will!</a>
						</p>
					
					
						</li>
					
						<li>
							<h4 class="dashedborder">Writing</h4> 
						
							<p>Much like I read, I write. I usually prefer English when it comes to self-expression 
								as it flows more naturally to me. Here's a favorite piece of mine (written by yours truly):
							</p>
						
							<blockquote>
								I am a creature of the stars. I shine bright, I die great, then I am reborn again. 
								I am forever wandering, looking for myself, and you. 
								I am bits and pieces that never cease to exist. 
								I am only forcefully and beautifully reconstructed again. 
								I am of many faces, feelings, and beings. 
								I am a lover of the night, a friend of the moon, and a daughter of the universe. 
								I see galaxies in your eyes, reminding me that heaven exists. 
								Reminding me that in this cold vastness of broken pieces, you're a perfect picture. 
							</blockquote>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4 class="dashedborder">Singing</h4> I adore music so so much. 
							<p>	
								I believe that Music is a language that few can speak but almost all can understand.
								I listen to anything that resonates with me, or can help me relax or have fun.
							</p>

				Get to know me as an aspiring Tech girl!
			</h2>
			
			<div class="container2">
				<h3>My background in Tech</h3>
				
				<p>My background in Tech starts as an early teen watching her older brother trying to fix the family shared computer -
				both in hardware and software departments. I was so fascinated with this machine that could play games,
				display all kinds of media and useful programs that I just had to get to know it.
				I learned how to take it apart, put it together again, and figured out how to fix it. 
				I learned how to navigate through its software and got to know what lies beyond it - the internet.

				<div class="container2">
				<ul>
				<div class="container2">
					<li> 
						<h4>I am a determined person</h4>
						<p> 
							Web development isn't a foreign concept to me.
							Mainly due to the fact that I've been researching this field and trying to learn on my own for a while.
							I do confess that sometimes I would get discouraged and fall back behind a lot, 
							but I know that this is something I want and am willing to work for. 
						</p>
					</li>
				</div>	
				<div class="container2">	
					<li>
						<h4>I am willing to help and share knowledge</h4>
						
						<p>
							I am someone who loves sharing knowledge as much as gaining knowledge. Helping
							others, guiding them and making their lives easier is something I absolutely adore.  
						</p>
					</li>
				</div>
				<div class="container2">
					<li>
						<h4>I like both logical and creative thinking</h4> 
						
						<p>	I am a person that loves logic and reason as much as I love creating things.
							I love both the steps involved in creating something and the art that comes with it. 
						</p>
					</li>
				</div>
				<div class="container2">
					<li>
						<h4>This opportunity would literally change my life</h4>
						<p>
							I graduated highschool two years ago, but due to financial struggles
							and personal issues I couldn't pursue higher education. Now I work as a janitor in an educational insitution (Galaxy training center) 
							in hopes that I could study Graphic Design whilst working there full time. 
						</p>
					</li>
				</div>	
				<div class="container2">
					<li>
						<h4>I adore the sense of community such an opportunity presents</h4>
						<p>
							The field of Web Development is relatively new, especially in this country. So the community is 
							still brand new and growing, and I would love to be one of the people who contributes to its growth and presence.
							Whilst meeting like-minded people, sharing ideas and accomplishments.
